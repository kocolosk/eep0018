This module strives to prepare an EEP0018 implemenation. It implements most of the 
functionality described there, with some additional features.  

YAJL
====

The parsing engine that drives behind that module is YAJL, see http://lloydforge.org/projects/yajl/.
The source tree contains a copy of that library, currently at version 0.4.0.
 
Differences to EEP 18
=======================

EEP 18's json_to_term function defines parsing of JSON objects. As CouchDB
needs a JSON parser that is able to parse JSON values this implementation adds
this functionality.

Implemenation Status
====================

The current development is done on OS/X 10.5. Other OSes might need a tuned
Makefile.

Critical Discussion
